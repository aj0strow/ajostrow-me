<p>Thanks for visiting my site!</p>

<p>
	I’m an undergraduate <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/ece/" target="_blank">Software Engineering</a> student at <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">McGill University</a>. I spend my time building web applications with startups, and I made this site to keep track of my software development &hellip; development. 
</p>
<p>
	I started programming at <a href="http://garfieldhs.seattleschools.org/" target="_blank">Garfield High School</a> in Seattle. My first class was in beginning Python. I went on to AP Computer Science in Java the next year. Helene Martin taught us Scheme at the beginning of the course, so I had an early introduction to scripting, object-oriented, and functional languages. 
</p>

<p>
	Starting in high school I interned three summers in a row with ADP Dealer Services (originally <a href="http://www.cobalt.com/" target="_blank">Cobalt</a>) in downtown Seattle. I had the pleasure of working for Chris Mills, and learned a ton from the whole team across the entire corporate application stack. 
</p>

<p>
	I moved to Montreal to study at McGill, and started spending a lot of time on extracurricular programming. I experimented with Android, finally releasing my first app Mastermind with the help of Jacob Barnett. I hit a roadblock with Android, as I did not know how to interact with a server, and thus started learning Ruby on Rails.

<p>
	Throughout my second year of university, I worked with Tal and Gary Schwartz on 4More, and we started <a href="http://4moreinnovation.com/" target="_blank">4More Innovation</a>, the parent company. I also slowly immersed myself into the Canadian startup community, frequenting the <a href="http://notman.org/en/" target="_blank">Notman House</a> and attending entrepeneur meetups. 
</p>

<p>
	After my second summer Artur Minacov and I were accepted into the <a href="http://incubes.ca/" target="_blank">INcubes</a> business acceleration program. I spent the summer in Toronto working on Modreal. 
</p>

<p>
	I’ve come to appreciate how much programming has given me, both in terms of career opportunities and critical thinking skills that apply to everything in life. I’d encourage you to start programming if you haven’t yet- it’s a pretty useful skill for modern life.
</p>

<p>
	I’m also a big believer in open source software and free information. Learning how to build applications would have been impossible without the wealth of open source software and online educational materials. I’ve read books, watched tutorials and talks, used powerful IDEs, hosted websites, and installed countless packages for a grand total of $0.

	Thanks for taking an interest in me, and I hope you enjoy the rest of the site!
